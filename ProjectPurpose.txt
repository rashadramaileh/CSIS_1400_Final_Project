	To help students study for finals, a program to display user created flashcards would be useful.
 A menu will be displayed to the user to offer a type of flash card (What information is held). This will 
utilize a switch. Once a type is chosen, a method would be called to guide the user through the process of 
creating flashcards. The package java.util.ArrayLists will be used to add information. When the user is 
ready, another method will be called to display each flashcard on a Jpane window. If the user enters the
 right information, the card will not be displayed. The user can leave if the Jpane is closed or all 
flashcards are completed.
